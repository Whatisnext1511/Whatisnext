      <h2>What is IELTS?</h2>
      <p>The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is a standardized test that measures English language proficiency for non-native speakers. It is accepted by universities, employers, immigration authorities, and professional bodies around the world.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">As a student aiming to pursue postgraduate studies in a native English-speaking country, it is essential to take and pass the IELTS exam in accordance with the standards set by the relevant examination board. Most universities and academic institutions require the <strong>Academic</strong> version of the IELTS. Below is a brief overview of the four key sections included in the IELTS Academic test.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Test Components</h2>
      <p>The IELTS exam is divided into four sections, all of which are mandatory:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Listening</strong> – 30 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Reading</strong> – 60 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Writing</strong> – 60 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Speaking</strong> – 11–14 minutes</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Listening</h2>
      <p>This section requires you to listen to audio recordings and answer questions that follow, often by filling in the blanks. The audio is played while the questions are displayed.</p>
      <p>The section has four parts, with ten questions in each. The questions follow the order of the recording.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> A conversation between two speakers in a social situation (e.g., discussing travel arrangements).</li>
        <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> A monologue in a social context (e.g., a speech about local facilities).</li>
        <li><strong>Part 3:</strong> A conversation between two main speakers in an academic setting (e.g., two students discussing an assignment, possibly guided by a tutor).</li>
        <li><strong>Part 4:</strong> A lecture or monologue on an academic subject.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Listening: Types of Questions</h2>
      <h3>Question Type 1 – Multiple Choice</h3>
      <p>This type of question may be a question with three possible answers or the first half of a sentence with three possible sentence endings. You have to choose one correct answer: A, B, or C, then write the correct letter.</p>

      <h3>Question Type 2 – Matching</h3>
      <p>You have to match a list of items from the recording to a list of options on the question paper. Then, write the correct letter on the answer sheet.</p>

      <h3>Question Type 3 – Plan/Map/Diagram Labelling</h3>
      <p>In this type of question, you must complete labels on a visual, which may be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A diagram (e.g., a piece of equipment)</li>
        <li>A set of pictures</li>
        <li>A plan (e.g., of a building)</li>
        <li>A map (e.g., part of a town)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Select your answers from a list on the question paper, then write the correct letter on the answer sheet.</p>

      <h3>Question Type 4 – Form/Note/Table/Flow Chart/Summary Completion</h3>
      <p>In this type of question, you fill in gaps in an outline of the recording’s key ideas. The format may be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A form:</strong> Often used for factual information like names.</li>
        <li><strong>A set of notes:</strong> Summarises key ideas and shows relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>A table:</strong> Organises information into categories (e.g., time, place, price).</li>
        <li><strong>A flow chart:</strong> Summarises process stages, using arrows.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Select words from the recording that fit into the gaps.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pay close attention to word limits, e.g., “NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER.”</li>
        <li>You lose marks for writing too many words.</li>
        <li>Contracted forms like “they’re” are not tested.</li>
        <li>Hyphenated words like “check-in” count as one word.</li>
        <li>Write only words that fit grammatically into the sentence or structure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Question Type 5 – Sentence Completion</h3>
      <p>You’ll read sentences that summarise key points in the recording and complete them using missing information.</p>

      <h3>Question Type 6 – Short-Answer Questions</h3>
      <p>You’ll read a question and write a short answer based on what you hear in the recording.</p>

     <h2>3. Writing</h2>
  <p>Lasting for ~60 mins involving two tasks:</p>

  <p><strong>In Task 1</strong>, you have to describe some visual information in your own words (a graph, table, chart or diagram). You need to write at least 150 words in about 20 minutes.</p>

  <p><strong>In Task 2</strong>, you are given a point of view, argument or problem which you need to discuss. You need to write at least 250 words in about 40 minutes.</p>

  <p>You must write your answers using full sentences.</p>
 <p></p> You must not write your answers as notes or bullet points.</p>
  <p></p>You must write your answers on the answer sheet. </p>
  <p></p>You are allowed to write notes on the question paper, but these will not be seen by the examiner.</p>

  <p>In Task 1, all the information you require is given in the diagram. You should write in an academic or semi-formal/neutral style.</p>

  <p>You must write at least 150 words and will be penalised if your answer is too short. While you will not be penalised for writing more than 150 words, you should remember that a longer Task 1 answer may mean that you have less time to spend on Task 2, which contributes twice as much to your Writing band score.</p>

  <p>In Task 2, Task response includes how well you develop your argument in response to the task, giving evidence and examples which may be from your own experience. Your answer should discuss the most relevant issues. You should spend no more than 40 minutes on this task. You must write at least 250 words and will be penalised if your answer is too short.</p>

  <p>Depending on the task type, you will be assessed on your ability to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Present a solution to a problem</li>
    <li>Present and justify an opinion</li>
    <li>Compare and contrast evidence, opinions and implications</li>
    <li>Evaluate and challenge ideas, evidence or an argument.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Speaking</h2>
  <p>The Speaking test is a face-to-face interview between the candidate and an examiner. The Speaking test is recorded.</p>
  <p>There are three parts to the test, and each part follows a specific pattern of tasks in order to test your speaking ability in different ways.</p>

  <h3>Marking</h3>
  <p>Certificated IELTS examiners assess your speaking performance throughout the test. There are four assessment criteria (things which the examiner thinks about when deciding what score to give you):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fluency and coherence</li>
    <li>Lexical resource</li>
    <li>Grammatical range and accuracy</li>
    <li>Pronunciation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Fluency and coherence</strong> assesses how well you can speak at a normal speed without too much hesitation.</p>
  <p><strong>Lexical resource</strong> assesses the range of vocabulary you use and how accurately and appropriately you use vocabulary to express meaning. It also includes the ability to express yourself using alternative vocabulary when you don’t know a particular word.</p>
  <p><strong>Grammatical range and accuracy</strong> assesses the range of grammar you use and how accurately and appropriately you use it.</p>
  <p><strong>Pronunciation</strong> assesses your ability to speak in a way which can be understood without too much effort.</p>

  <h3>Part 1 – Introduction and interview</h3>
  <p>In this part, the examiner introduces him/herself and checks your identity. Then the examiner asks you general questions on some familiar topics, such as home, family, work, studies or interests.<br>
  Part 1 is 4–5 minutes long.</p>

  <h3>Part 2 – Long turn</h3>
  <p> Part 2 is the individual long turn. The examiner gives you a task card which asks you to talk about a particular topic. The card tells you what points you should include in your talk and instructs you to explain one aspect of the topic. You have one minute to prepare your talk, and the examiner will give you a pencil and paper to make notes.</p>
  <p>By using the points on the task card and making notes during the preparation time, you should be able to think of appropriate things to say, and have time to structure your talk so that you keep talking for 2 minutes.</p>
  <p>The examiner will then ask you to begin talking and will stop you when the time is up. They may then ask you one or two questions on the same topic.<br>
  Part 2 lasts 3–4 minutes, including the preparation time.</p>

  <h3>Part 3 – Discussion</h3>
  <p>In Part 3, you and the examiner discuss issues related to the topic in Part 2 in a more general and abstract way and, where appropriate, in greater depth.<br>
  Part 3 lasts 4–5 minutes.</p>
