      <h2>PLAB 1 Overview</h2>
      <p>Once you’ve successfully cleared the IELTS, PLAB 1 is a multiple-choice examination consisting of 180 questions. You are given 3 hours to complete the exam. The questions are designed to assess a candidate’s ability to apply medical knowledge in clinical scenarios that reflect real-life situations encountered by doctors working in the UK.</p>

      <p><strong>Exam Schedule:</strong> PLAB 1 is held four times a year, typically in February, May, August, and November. The exam is conducted in various countries worldwide, in approved test centers designated by the General Medical Council (GMC).</p>

      <p><strong>Booking and Registration:</strong> To take the exam, candidates must register and book their exam slot through the General Medical Council (GMC) website. Since exam dates and slots are limited and tend to fill quickly, it is strongly recommended to monitor the GMC website regularly for announcements regarding booking openings.</p>

      <p>Candidates should ensure they meet the eligibility criteria, including holding a primary medical qualification accepted by the GMC and demonstrating the required level of English proficiency (as mentioned above), before attempting to book the exam.</p>

      <p><strong>Results and Attempts:</strong> Results typically take up to 8 weeks to be released. You are given a maximum of 4 attempts to pass PLAB 1. The minimum passing score is usually 117, with scores ranging up to 180.</p>

    <h2>PLAB 1 tips</h2>
    <p>
Sources we would recommend for Plab 1 would be:
<li>Plabable+Gems
<li>Plab1keys

<p>After thoroughly reviewing PLAB 1 Keys, working through the Plabable question bank, and carefully reading the explanations given for each question, will help you gain a much deeper understanding of the clinical scenarios and reasoning behind each answer</p>

<p>The mock exams provided by Plabable are particularly valuable, as they closely simulate the format and timing of the actual PLAB 1 exam. These mocks not only provide a performance score but also offer detailed explanations for every answer—regardless of whether you get it right or wrong—helping to reinforce your knowledge and clarify key concepts.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to attempt as many mock exams as possible to build confidence, identify areas of weakness, and improve your overall exam readiness.</p>

<h2>PLAB 2 OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>PLAB 2 is an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) designed to evaluate your clinical skills and ability to apply medical knowledge in practical, real-world scenarios. Unlike PLAB 1, PLAB 2 is held exclusively in Manchester, UK, so international candidates must travel to the UK to take this exam.</p>

<p>The entire process takes about 3 hours, which includes registration, identity checks, and briefing. The exam itself lasts approximately 2 hours and 10 minutes.</p>

<p>PLAB 2 consists of 16 clinical stations, each lasting 8 minutes. Before entering each station, candidates have 1.5 minutes to read and prepare for the scenario. During the station, a 2-minute warning is given to help you manage your time and conclude your consultation smoothly.</p>

<p>Results are typically released within 3 to 4 weeks after the exam date. Candidates are allowed a maximum of four attempts.</p>

<h2>References for PLAB 2:</h2>

<p>While some candidates choose to enroll in PLAB 2 preparation academies to enhance their skills and confidence, this decision is entirely dependent on individual preferences and learning styles. Many successful candidates prepare independently using online resources, practice groups, and mock scenarios</p>

<p>PLAB 2 covers a wide range of clinical topics and scenarios, designed to reflect real-life situations faced in UK medical practice. </p>
<p>The exam stations may include:</p>
<p>SimMan Stations: These involve the use of a simulator to assess management of emergency situations such as postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) or acute exacerbation of COPD etc.</p>
<p>Ethical Scenarios: These test your communication and decision-making skills in situations involving difficult colleagues, medical errors, breaking bad news, or dealing with an angry or distressed patient.</p>
<p>Medical Stations: Topics include specialties like cardiology and neurology as well as follow-up or review consultations.</p>
<p>Paediatrics and Psychiatry: Focused on developmental concerns, safeguarding, mental health assessments, and family interactions.</p>

<p>Combined Stations: These may require both history taking and a targeted physical examination within the time limit.</p>
<p>ENT and Ophthalmology: Involve practical assessment and explanation of common ear, nose, throat, and eye conditions etc. </p>
<p>Obstetrics and Gynaecology includes assessing the gestational age of pregnant patients, performing examinations as well as teaching procedures such as the per speculum examination</p>
<p>As well as performing procedures like IV cannulation, foley’s catheterisation, etc</p>
<p>The advantage of academies is that they allow you to familiarize yourself with the manikins and practice procedures; however, there are several other resources that can help you with this as well.</p>
<p>Each station assesses not just clinical knowledge, but also communication, empathy, and professionalism, all within a structured OSCE format</p>
however doing mocks from any source atleast 2 with good feedback is highly recommended</p>
