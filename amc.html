      <h2>AMC 1 Overview</h2>
      <p>The AMC 1 exam is a multiple choice exam where in each question has five options of which only one is correct. The exam consists of 150 questions held over a period of 3 hours with an extra 10 minutes prior to the exam for tutorials. The exam covers clinical subjects and the questions are usually case-based scenarios that are encountered during practice in Australia as well as questions based on medical ethics and treating guidelines. The questions are formatted as long case scenarios which require thorough reading.</p>

      <p><strong>Exam Schedule:</strong>The exam is held almost every month, except for during December and January and the exams can be attempted from various centres across the world.</p>

      <p><strong>Booking and Registration:</strong>Candidates can book the exam through the Pearson VUE portal.</p>
      <p>Candidates must ensure they meet the required eligibility and provide details of their primary medical degree, state licences (if any) as well as government ID cards and address proofs.

    <h2>AMC 1 tips</h2>
    <p>
Sources we would recommend for AMC 1 would be:
<li>AMC Handbook</li>
<li>Murtaugh's general practice</li>
<li>Red book of ethics</li>
<li>Online sources like MplusX and AMEDEX</li>

<p>After reviewing topics in Murtaugh's and perusing the Red Book, testing yourself with the questions in the Handbook and Annotated MCQ questions will give a better understanding to type of questions and the keywords to look out for while answering the questions in the exam.</p>

<p>The official AMC website provides a mock exam simulating the real exam time and the question pattern but there are various platforms and study groups that provide mini mock tests that will help boost prep.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to attempt as many mock exams as possible to build confidence, identify areas of weakness, and improve your overall exam readiness.</p>

<h2>AMC 2 OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>AMC 2 is an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) designed to evaluate your clinical skills and ability to apply medical knowledge in practical, real-world scenarios. Unlike AMC 1, AMC 2 is held exclusively in Melbourne, Australia, so international candidates must travel to Australia to take this exam.</p>

<p>The entire process takes about 4-5 hours, which includes registration, identity checks, and briefing. The exam itself lasts approximately 3 hours.</p>

<p>AMC 2 consists of 16 clinical stations, each lasting 10 minutes. Before entering each station, candidates have 2 minutes to read and prepare for the scenario. During the station, a 2-minute warning is given to help you manage your time and conclude your consultation smoothly.Of the 16 stations, the exam also includes 4 rest stations that are not scored.</p>

<p>Each candidate is required to pass 9 stations to clear the exam.</p>
<p>Results are typically released within 3 to 4 weeks after the exam date. Candidates are allowed a maximum of three attempts after which they have to wait for a calendar year to try again.</p>

<h2>References for AMC 2:</h2>

<p>Online resources like geeky medics and various other videos help improve skills like communication and diagnosis</p>
<p>Some candidates also prefer joining workshops and classes that help with preparation</p>
<p>Study groups and mock role plays with peers are also known to be beneficial in the preparation process.</p>

  <h2>WBA Overview</h2>
  <p>The WBA is a clinical assessment that allows candidates to be assessed in a daily work environment instead of a traditional exam setting.</p>
  <p>It includes -</p>
  <li>Mini clinical evaluation exercise</li>
  <li>Direct observation of procedural skills</li>
  <li>Case based discussions</li>
  <li>In training assessments</li>
  <li>Feedback from colleagues, patients and supervisors</li>
  <p>This might seem like a better option but bear in mind that there are very few hospitals certified to conduct this program and that makes the program extremely competitive to get into.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Competent Authority Pathway</h2>
  <p>There is a third pathway to practice and train in Australia and that is via the competent authority pathway. Here candidates who have cleared exams like PLAB, MCCQE, NZREX and certain other exams in European countries recognised by Australia, and have successfully completed one year of training or work experience in that particular country, can directly apply for general registration in Australia.</p>
  <p>It is for these select exams - the full list of accepted exams is on the AMC website- are exempted from writing the AMC exams and these candidates bypass the exams to gain general registration in Australia.</p>
  <p>Please bear in mind that just clearing the exams is NOT sufficient. You must also have proof of training or working in that particular country for a minimum of one year to qualify for this pathway</p>
